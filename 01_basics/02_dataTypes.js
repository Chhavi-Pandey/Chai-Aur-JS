"use strict";    // treat all js code as the newer version of js; now by default it is always in newer version without even writing "use strict" but still it's a good practice and to know

// Using semi-colon is sometimes needed sometimes not some says using this is a good practice some says it is not. Overall the purpose is only improve the readability of code

// Data Types: number, bigint, string, boolean, null, undefined,symbol
// We've discussed about undefined and also aware with number, boolean, and string and also bigint as it only used when the number is so big.    
// null: standalone value and of course it is a type.(empty value)
// symbol : unique


// object (non primitive)

console.log(typeof null) // typeof used for finding the type of value 
// and here is the typeof null which is object; (and it is interesting)
console.log(typeof undefined);
